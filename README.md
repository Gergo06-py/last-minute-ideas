# Last Minute Ideas

## This project is aiming to be a simple and easy to use, note taking app enchanced with AI that over time keeps track of the way you write your notes and enhances them by keeping your natural tone. (AI features can be turned off in settings)

### The app is still in its early development stages, so there are no compiled versions available. You are welcome to clone the project and try it out if you'd like. The project is kept under the GPLv3 license.

### `You may fork and modify this project, but redistribution of modified versions under a different project or brand name is prohibited without explicit permission.`
