# Last Minute Ideas

## This project is aiming to be a simple and easy to use, note taking app enchanced with AI that over time learns your tone and enhances your notes by keeping your natural tone. (AI features can be turned off in options)

## The app is still in its early development stages, so there are no compiled versions available. You are welcome to clone the project and try it out if you'd like. The project is released under the GNU GPLv3 license. Forks and contributions are welcome, but redistribution under a different name or for commercial purposes is **not allowed without permission**.
